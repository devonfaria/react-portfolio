## Description

Welcome to my Web Developer Portfolio, powered by React. This site uses React components to dynamically build the website so that it does not reload when visiting each subpages content. Additionally, the page accepts messages from a contact form that will later feed into a database on the backend. 

Additional features include linked icons to GitHub, LinkedIn, and email from the footer, and a linked resume that opens in a new tab. Other functionalities include is to inform the user that the field is required if left blank in the contact form, and validating emails for valid syntax once submitted.

## Visuals

This is the About Me landing page for the portfolio, with tabs to navigate to the subpages without reloading, and footer icons that link to Github, LinkedIn, and email.
